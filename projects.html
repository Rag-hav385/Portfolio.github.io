        <h2>Revenue Impact on Games through GamePass Availablity</h2>

        <p>
          <b> Associated with Microsoft Xbox </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Data Science Intern at Xbox, I was involved in Game Pass Impact
          Revenue Analysis Across Games
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Game Pass Impact Analysis: Analyzed the impact of Xbox Game Pass on
            game consumption and player reach, identifying potential declines in
            purchases and unearned recurring revenue.
          </li>

          <li>
            Revenue Prediction: Predicted potential loss in base game revenue
            using CausalML models, focusing on unearned recurring revenue from
            Game Pass titles.
          </li>

          <li>
            Modelling: Trained Time Series forecasting predictive models for
            understanding treatment effect of game pass availability and also
            used CausalML models, such as T-learner to understand CounterFacual
            of Game Releasing in Game Pass.

        <h2>Fuel Economy Optimization</h2>

        <p>
          <b> Associated with Cummins Inc. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fuel Economy Optimization, recommend trimmable parameter combinations
          that maximize fuel economy for customer fleets.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Clustering made clusters of the trips of the unit on param basis,
            these non-trimmable engine data include duty cycles and driver
            behaviours. Through this, trips can be categorized into different
            sectors for better recommendation of trimmable params, as for the
            new trip, this will help outline the behaviour and take out the
            similar trips, through Similarity.
          </li>

          <li>
            Regression developed accurate boosting models to predict fuel
            economy using trimmable (engine specs) and non-trimmable (duty
            cycle, driver behaviour) engine data for each cluster.
          </li>

          <li>
            Developed the pipeline, with three main principles, i.e.,
            Clustering, Similarity & Regression, to predict the Optimized Fuel
            Economy on fleet and unit level, for the recommendation of trimmable
            parameters, based on prediction made.

        <h2>Oil Reset Event Detection of an Engine</h2>

          <b> Associated with Cummins Inc. </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Oil Reset Detection, detection of oil change for the Engine specific
          unit based on the parameters present in the pipeline, which will
          remove the dependency of customer manual inputs for the reset events,
          in the production phase.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Devised a data pre-processing approach, with appropriate filtering
            of data with the help of the subject matter experts.
          </li>

          <li>
            Trained a classification model, with a leverage of vicinity factor
            for the prediction of oil reset events.
          </li>

          <li>
            Implemented a Business Logic based on the customer and service
            literature, for Minimizing False positives for the model.
          </li>

          <li>
            Created a Range Metric for the evaluation of model based on customer
            input.

        <h2>Fuel Cell Electrode â€“ Crack Classification</h2>

        <p>
          <b> Associated with Cummins Inc. </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Initiated collaboration of Hydrogenic Team and AAI team in Cummins.
          With the objective to detect crack defects in x-ray images of fuel
          cell electrodes we have experimented with both statistical models and
          state of the art deep learning models used today for image
          classification purposes. Applying Non-Destructive Evaluation
          techniques like X-rays for image acquisition of Hydrogenic Fuel Cell
          Electrode, we engineered numerical features using the right shift in
          pixel distribution which helped our statistical model to classify
          defected and non-defected parts with an accuracy of 88%. For
          Inferencing, a graphical user interface was developed to collect the
          batch and visualize the results with report creation functionality,
          for the ease of model use.

        <p><b> Research associated with SRM University </b></p>
        <p>
          This paper describes our work on building a Classification system for
          video subtitles. As an example, we report on our evaluation results
          for two TV genres -Academic and Entertainment. Through this
          implementation, the user can classify the videos into academic and
          entertainment in any software or system, which will help the user to
          differentiate the videos properly into useful and distracting content.
          This enables applications like social networking and instant messaging
          apps to filter distracting content, thereby enhancing productivity of
          users.
