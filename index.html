        <p>Hi, my name is Raghav Agarwal. Welcome to my portfolio.</p>

        <p>
          I am a passionate data scientist with a strong foundation in data
          analytics, machine learning, data science, and deep learning.
          Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at George
          Washington University. My academic journey, combined with over three
          years of professional experience, has equipped me with a comprehensive
          understanding of data-driven problem solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have had the privilege of working as a Data Scientist Intern at
          Microsoft, where I was part of the Xbox team and applied my analytical
          skills in real-world settings using causal inference. My previous role
          as a Data Scientist at Cummins Inc. further strengthened my expertise,
          where I contributed as a core member of the Advance Analytics Team.

          Outside of work, I am a big One Piece fan and love playing team
          sports. Iâ€™m always up for exploring something new and never shy away
          from enjoying good food.
